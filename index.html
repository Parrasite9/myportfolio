            <p class="subtitle">About Me</p>
            <a href="" class="featured-title">Isaiah Johnson</a>
            <p class="featured-desc">
              As a skilled Software Engineer / Web Developer, I am excited about the opportunity to bring my passion for coding, business, and food to your project. 
              With a strong background in coding, I have an innate understanding of the creative potential of web design, and I am always eager to push the limits of what is possible with my work. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Drawing on my experience starting and selling businesses, I have gained a keen sense of what it takes to create a website that not only looks great but also functions smoothly and meets the unique needs of a particular enterprise. 
              I take pride in my ability to bring web designs to life, whether that be from a concept design or something pulled from my imagination. 
              <br />
              <br />
              But let's get real for a second, folks. Coding and business are all well and good, but let's talk about the real MVP of my life: hot wings. 
              I'm not saying they're the secret to all success, but they're definitely the secret to mine. Whether I'm in the middle of coding a complex project or strategizing a new business venture, I always keep a plate of hot wings nearby to keep me fueled and focused. 
              I like 'em spicy, I like 'em saucy, and I like 'em by the dozen. So, if you're looking for a Software Engineer / Web Developer who's not afraid to get a little messy with a pile of wings while working on your project, I'm your guy! 
              <br />
              <br />
              Overall, I believe that my combination of technical expertise, business acumen, and creative passion makes me an ideal candidate for any project where innovation, attention to detail, and the ability to deliver exceptional results are highly valued. 
              I look forward to the opportunity to bring my skills to your team and help take your project to the next level.
